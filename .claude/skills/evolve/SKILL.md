description: Define a goal. AI builds, evaluates, and iterates until it's met. Use with /loop 1m /evolve for continuous autonomous operation.

# Evolve V2: Define Goal → Auto Build → Auto Evaluate → Iterate Until Done

## Overview

Three agents, one loop: O (Orchestrator) → B (Builder) → C (Critic) → B → C → ... → Done

- **Init**: This file. O guides user through 4 steps.
- **Loop**: `loop.md`. B and C run automatically via `/loop 1m /evolve`.

Hard dependencies: Python 3.8+, Git. Everything else is declared by the project adapter.

Agent definitions: `agents/orchestrator.md`, `agents/builder.md`, `agents/critic.md`.

## Trigger Routing

```
/evolve triggered
    │
Check if .evolve/ exists?
    ├── not exists → First-time setup (Step 1)
    └── exists → Check state:
         ├── no adapter.py → Step 3
         ├── no program.md → Step 3 (generate program.md)
         ├── no results.tsv or empty → Step 4 (validation)
         └── results.tsv has data → Enter loop (loop.md)
```

## Init Flow (4 steps)

### Step 1: Project Scan (automatic)

Scan language, framework, test framework, directory structure. Output brief summary:

> "Detected Node.js + Express project, has vitest, entry at app/main.js"

### Step 2: Brainstorming (interactive, core step)

O talks to user following /brainstorming principles:
- One question at a time
- Multiple choice preferred
- Goal: help user clarify three things — what they want, what "good" means, what's off limits

```
Q1: "What do you want to build? One sentence."

Q2: "Core features? I suggest based on your project:
     A. JWT authentication
     B. Chat endpoint
     C. File upload
     D. Other: ___"

Q3: "What matters for quality?
     A. Tests pass (deterministic)
     B. Code quality (AI review)
     C. API design (AI review)
     D. Other: ___"

Q4: "Score threshold per dimension? Default 7/10."

Q5: "Constraints?
     A. No new dependencies
     B. Don't touch xxx directory
     C. No limits
     D. Other: ___"
```

3-5 questions, ~2 minutes. O may suggest skills for user to install based on project type:

```
"Detected web app project. Recommend installing:
  - /qa → systematic testing during evaluation
  - /browse → live page inspection
  Optional — works without them, but evaluation quality improves."
```

### Step 3: Generate program.md (automatic + user review)

Auto-generate from Step 1 scan + Step 2 conversation:

```markdown
# Program

## Product Requirements
<from Step 2>

## Feature List
- [ ] Feature A
- [ ] Feature B
- [ ] Feature C

## Evaluation Criteria
dimensions:
  - name: <dimension name>
    type: deterministic | llm-judged
    cmd: <command>  # optional, for deterministic
    threshold: <float>

## Technical Constraints
- Stack: <from Step 1 scan>
- Dependency limits: <from user>
- No-go zones: <from user>

## Agent Rules
- Do not modify program.md
- Do not modify files under .claude/skills/evolve/
- Git commit after each agent run
- Build output appended to .evolve/run.log
```

Show to user: "Here's your program.md. Want to adjust?"

Also generate `.evolve/spec.md` (context injection for B and C agents):
1. Scan project for existing design/spec/requirements documents (e.g. `docs/`, `specs/`, `*.spec.md`, PRDs)
2. Ask user: "Found these documents. Which ones should B and C agents see every round?"
3. Concatenate selected documents into `.evolve/spec.md`
4. This file is loaded as **Full text** by B and C every round (see loop.md reading list #2)
5. If no documents found, ask user if they want to write requirements inline or skip

**Why this matters:** Without spec.md, B agent must find and read source documents each round, wasting context and risking missed context. spec.md ensures both B and C always have the full product requirements and design in their context window.

Also generate `.evolve/adapter.py`:
1. Read `adapters/base.py` for interface definition
2. Read `adapters/web_app.py` or `adapters/teaching.py` as reference
3. Auto-generate project-specific adapter

### Step 4: Validation + Branch Creation (automatic)

#### Validation

| Check | Rule | Failure |
|-------|------|---------|
| Product requirements | At least 1 non-empty | "Product requirements are empty." |
| Eval dimensions | At least 1 | "No eval dimensions." |
| Template placeholders | No `{{` or `[fill...]` | "program.md line N is still a placeholder" |
| adapter.py | Importable | "adapter.py load failed: {error}" |
| Python 3.8+ | Available | "Python 3.8+ required" |
| Git | Available | "Git required" |
| Uncommitted changes | Warn | "!! Recommend committing first" |

#### Setup

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.claude/skills/evolve')
from prepare import load_adapter, load_eval_config
```

- `git checkout -b evolve/<tag>`
- Generate `.evolve/adapter.py` (from reference adapters + project scan)
- Create `.evolve/results.tsv` (header only)
- Create `.evolve/strategy.md` (empty template)
- Create `.evolve/run.log` (empty)
- Add `.evolve/` to `.gitignore`

```
Init complete. Run /loop 1m /evolve to start.
```
